# Effects of Macroeconomic Data on Bitcoin Price Prediction using Time Series Forecasting Techniques

Research Questions:
1. To what extent does incorporating macroeconomic data improve prediction accuracy in multivariate time series modelling approaches, including LSTM, XGBoost, GRU, TCN, and DeepVAR?
2. Are there outliers which exhibit results that don’t correspond with the majority of the models in terms of macroeconomic data’s effect?
